     Welcome! My Emma L., and I am currently a junior at the California Academy of Mathematics and Science. I hope to continue my education to further pursue a career in biostatistics and computer science. 
  
  I strive to be a hard worker and productive. My summer consisted of online classes, hanging out with friends, shopping, gaming, and spending time with family.

  For my junior year, I am taking a total of seven class; five of which are AP classes. My favorite class is Biotechnology. This class had taught me the possiblities science can unlock. I learned how to prepare samples for PCR, gel electrophoresis, and different lab equipment. We have conducted labs to determine if our DNA is heterozygous or homozygous, if a food is a GMO, and currently, conducting a lab to determine the culprit of a crime scene.
  
  I hope my website can inspire and bring positivity to your day. Enjoy and have a good day! :)

    <p>UCLA! UCLA! The name brings me joy. My hardwork and dedication to my studies all come down to getting myself into a prestigious college, specifically UCLA. UCLA has such a bright, energetic community that I feel that I can thrive in. 
  
  At UCLA, I hope to major statistics or computer science, and if possible double major in both.
